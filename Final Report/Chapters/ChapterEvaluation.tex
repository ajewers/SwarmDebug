The final stage in this project was system evaluation. Software testing can be used to verify that a system works as intended, however as the system created in this project is experimental in nature, it was also necessary to determine the extent to which it is useful in practice. The purpose of the system evaluation stage was therefore to have the system be used for its intended purpose and evaluate its effectiveness. In order to achieve this \textit{User Evaluation Sessions} were carried out, where potential system users with no involvement in the system's development were asked to use the system to complete a number of tasks, and data was recorded regarding their experience. This data was obtained through direct observation of the participants interaction with the system, and through a follow up questionnaire designed to gauge their opinions on the system.

\section{Method}

The user evaluation sessions followed an observed testing format. Participants were given control of the system, which was initialised to a known state, and asked to complete a number of tasks, ranging from simple information and data location and retrieval to a full simulated debugging task. Data was collected by taking notes on how the participants interacted with the system, including any difficulties they had, and any comments they made whilst using it. The primary areas of interest for these notes were how easily the participant was able to navigate the user interface and obtain information, how often they asked for additional information, and what they asked for information regarding, as well as if (and how quickly) they were able to isolate and correct the deliberate behavioural fault. The process was structured as follows:

\subsection{Set Up}
Four robots were used during the sessions. Two simple behaviours were programmed for the robots prior to the start of the sessions. The first was a very simple test controller behaviour which had the robot drive slowly in a circular path, whilst reporting data for all of the types defined in the system. This included a watchdog packet every ten control steps containing a unique name for each robot,  varying state, which would change every fifty control steps between three possible values, active and background IR data, an arbitrary log message packet every hundred control steps and a custom data packet every ten control steps, containing the current total number of control steps as the data portion. The second behaviour was a simple dispersion behaviour, which would cause the robot to turn and drive away from any nearby object. This was achieved by monitoring the values of the robots IR sensors and calculating a heading vector in the opposite direction to any sensors above a certain threshold. Whilst executing this behaviour the robot was also reporting debugging information to the application. This included watchdog packets, active and passive IR data as before, and the control step as custom data all as before, as well as the state of the robot (which varied between \textit{IDLE} and \textit{MOVING}, depending on whether the robots IR threshold had been met, causing it to move). The IR value threshold in this behaviour was deliberately set too low, causing the robots to occasionally move randomly as a result of the fluctuations in the IR readings due to noise. This was done to simulate a bug in the robot's behaviour code, which participants were then asked to attempt to locate the cause of and fix using the debugging system.

Prior to the start of each session the robots were returned to this initial state, with the two behaviours loaded and the first behaviour running. The application was not set up in any way, and was run fresh for each session. It was important that this starting set up be the same for each participant, in order for the results to be comparable.

\subsection{Session Sequence}
The following sequence of steps was then carried out for each session. Where a user was asked to complete a task or use an element of the interface the instructions given were deliberately kept minimal, to see if the interface could be intuitively navigated. Participants were asked to say if they could not determine how to complete one of the tasks, at which point further guidance was given. Relevant observational notes were taken at each step.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Introduce the application to the participant, and have them run the executable.
 \item Explain the purpose of the application, and the purpose of this evaluation session.
 \item Indicate the key features within the application. Specifically identify the visualiser and explain its purpose, as well as the robot list panel and the data panel.
 \item Ask the participant to start the application listening for data packets on the network. Mention that this functionality can be found on the network tab only if necessary.
 \item The simple circular motion controller code should be running on the robots already. If it is not, run it now.
 \item Ask the participant to obtain the following pieces of information:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item The current state of robot 1
  \item The recent state changes of robot 2
  \item The current IR sensor values of robot 3
  \item The current value of the `ControlStep' custom data point for robot 4
  \item The set of known states for robot 1
  \item The numerical angle describing the orientation of robot 2
 \end{enumerate}
 \item Ask the participant to use the visualiser settings tab to achieve the following:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Hide the name and state visualisation for all robots
  \item Display the recent path for all robots
  \item Display the IR sensor data for the selected robot in heat mode
  \item Hide the position and orientation visualisation for all robots
  \item Display the custom data point `ControlStep' for the selected robot.
 \end{enumerate}
 \item Ask the participant to use the camera settings tab to add a mapping from ARuCo tag ID 2 to robot ID 10. Explain further if necessary.
 \item Ask the participant to use the logging tab to achieve the following:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Set the logging directory to a specific folder
  \item Start logging for a short period of time and then stop it.
 \end{enumerate}
 \item Stop the circular motion behaviour on the robots and switch to the dispersion behaviour.
 \item Make the dispersion behaviour source code available to the user.
 \item Explain the desired behaviour to the participant, and the current erroneous behaviour.
 \item Ask the participant to attempt to locate the cause of the issue using the data made available by the debugging system. Provide hints and advice only if necessary.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Questionnaire}
Following the practical session, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their experience, and their opinions of the system and its features. The questionnaire included the following questions:

\section{Participants}

Two groups of participants took part in the user evaluation sessions. The first was composed of `\textit{domain experts}'; researchers and other technical people with experience in the field of swarm robotics. This group were more likely to have an understanding of the needs of the system's target users, and therefore their input was considered more valuable. However because of the relatively niche nature of the field, the availability of participants in this category was limited. Hence only a small number could be found to participate in the sessions.

In order to remedy this lack of participants, the second group was introduced. This group was composed primarily of engineering students, who had little or no experience with swarm robotics specifically, beyond a basic understanding of the core concepts. Where necessary an introduction to the core concepts was given before the session. This group did however possess general knowledge regarding software development, as this was necessary to complete the sessions effectively. The results obtained from this group were therefore mostly useful to evaluate elements of the system unrelated to swarm robotics, such as the usability of the user interface and the clarity of information display. This difference is reflected in the analysis of the results.
