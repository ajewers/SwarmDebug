\section{Use Within the York Robotics Laboratory}

One of the key aims of this project was to create a system which is practical, usable, and offers real benefit to swarm robotics developers and researchers. In this capacity it is hoped that the application will continue to be used within the YRL to aid in swarm robotics research and development efforts, and that the application itself will see further development to build upon its core functionality in some of the ways previously mentioned.
