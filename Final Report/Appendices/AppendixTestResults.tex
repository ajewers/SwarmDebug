 \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Visualiser Panel Tab System}}\\
 \hline
 \textbf{Purpose} & Allows access to the different tabs within the visualiser panel.\\
 \textbf{Required Functionality} & Must display the names of each different tab. Must allow the user to click on the tabs and thus change between them. The required tabs are the visualiser tab, the visualiser settings tab and the tracking camera settings tab.\\

 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{\textbf{1. Examine UI element visually. Verify that it appears correct. Verify that it contains all elements necessary to satisfy its purpose.}}\\
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{The tab bar appears to be visually correct. All required tabs are present and visible.}\\
 \hline
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{\textbf{2. Examine all text within the element. Check for errors in both meaning and spelling.}}\\
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{The spelling of each tab name is correct. The meaning of each tab name is relatively clear, although 'Settings' is ambiguous, and only related to the visualiser through position and context. Consider renaming this tab to clarify its purpose.}\\
 \hline
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{\textbf{3. Verify that all components within the element which perform actions in response to user input operate correctly.}}\\
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{Tab selection operates correctly. Clicking any of the tabs changes the panel to display the contents of that tab. This satisfies the required functionality.}\\
 \hline
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{\textbf{4. Verify that all components respond quickly to user input.}}\\
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{The tab changes immediately when clicked.}\\
 \hline
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{\textbf{5. Verify that component actions and functionality do not degrade with extreme use (sustained rapid input, large numbers of input changes, etc).}}\\
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{Repeatedly and rapidly changing tabs does not have any detrimental affect on the application.}\\

 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{\textbf{6. Verify that all data displayed within the element is visible, readable, correctly arranged and correctly labelled.}}\\
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{n/a.}\\

 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{\textbf{7. Verify that the element behaves sensibly when window resizing occurs, and that it remains usable and data remains visible whenever possible.}}\\
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{The tabs are not affected by window resizing. All of the tabs fit within the minimum size of the panel. If the panel is reduced below this size it is minimized, and the tabs are hidden as intended.}\\

 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{Rapidly enabling and disabling settings multiple times has no detrimental affect. Disabling and re-enabling the robot colours setting causes the robots to be re-assigned colours randomly, which might be undesired behaviour.}\\
 \hline
 \multicolumn{2}{p{14cm}}{\textbf{6. Verify that all data displayed within the element is visible, readable, correctly arranged and correctly labelled.}}\\
