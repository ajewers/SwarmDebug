1: Title Slide
  Good afternoon, my name is Ali Jewers, and the project I am working on is titled 'An Augmented REality Debugging System for Robot Swarms', and my supervisor is Alan Millard.
  
2: Introduction - SR
  This project largely falls into the domain of Swarm Robotics, which is a relatively new area of research, focusing on a specific type of multi-robot system. The general concept is to use a large number of fairly simple robots to solve a task cooperatively. One of the main characteristics of a robot swarm as opposed to a regular multi-robot system is the lack of centralised control. The robots should enact a simple behaviour based on the information available to them locally, and without being directly instructed by some more knowledgeable control unit. This field of research originated from studies into the behaviour of social insects, and attmepts to recreate the observed behaviours in robots. The field has been gaining momentum in the last ten years due to the decreasing costs and size requirements of computing power and the increasing quality of small robotic components. Swarm robotics presents a fairly unique challenge for the researchers and developers creating swarm behaviours, as swarms can be very difficult to debug, due to the large number of robots involved, and the lack of a central control point to gather information from.
  
3: Introduction - Debugging Tools
  When considering implementing robotic behaviours as a programming task, it becomes apparent that there are some key differences. These largely stem from the fact that robots operate in a real-world environment rather than the digital environment of traditional software. This means there are a much greater range of inputs and factors that might affect the robot's decision making and overall behaviour. A lot of these inputs are fully continuous, rather than the discrete inputs commonly dealt with in the digital domain. This can make it almost impossible to exactly reproduce any observed fault, as there can be an infinite number of configurations for the influencing factors. It also leads to bugs being caused simply by the 'noise' inherent in a real world environment - the slight random variation in any sensor measurement or actuator movement. This problem is therefore amplified when debugging a swarm robotics system, as incresing the number of robots multiplies the number of these influencing factors. Traditional debugging tools, which are often text based, and require execution to be paused to retrieve information, are therefore not always sufficient when working in this space. New tools need to be created which can retrieve and display information from an active robot swarm in real time, in a manner which can be easily and quickly understood by a human operator.
  
4: Introduction - Augmented Reality
  Currently emerging augmented reality technologies present new opportunities for working with robots, and may pose a solution to the problem illustrated before. An augmented space combines a real space with a digital one, and creates a hybrid reality which can be directly understood and influenced by both humans and robots. Humans have an innate understanding of three dimensional spaces, and can parse information from these much faster than from text or numbers. Allowing humans and robots to share a mixed reality therefore has the potential to significatly broaden the human-robot communication channel.
  
5: Introduction - Project Concept
  Bearing in mind the three elements I've just discussed, this project aims to develop a software tool for monitoring and debugging robot swarms in real time. To do this it will include a live video feed of the robot swarm, and connect to each of the robots wirelessly to retrieve internal data. This can then be combined using techniques similar to data and sensor fusion, to create graphical representations of the data which can be used to augment the video feed.
  
6: Background - Hardware
  The practical work for this project is being carried out at the York Robotics Laboratory on the Hes East campus, and we are hopeful that once completed this tool can be used in practical research work within the lab. For the first version of the system, the initial target platform will be the e-puck robot. This is a widely used, small robot platform for education and research purposes, often used for swarm robotics research. For this projects the e-pucks have been configured with a Linux extension board, which runs a Debian-based operating system on an ARM9 chip, and a WiFi adapter. In this configuration the ARM chip controls the robot's higher level decision making and processing, and interaces with the robots default dsPIC chip which handles the low level sensor and actuator control. The YRL has some existing infrastructure in the form of a robot arena and a machine vision camera
