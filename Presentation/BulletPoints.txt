1: Title Slide
  - Good afternoon; name; title;
  - Start background swarm robotics
  
2: Introduction - SR
  - New
  - Multi-robot-system
  - General concept
  - Dstinguishing feature
  - Individual behaviour
  - Emergent result
  - Social insects
  - Decreasing cost
  - Unique challenge; many robots; no central point
  
3: Introduction - Debugging Tools
  - When programming robotic
  - Real world
  - More inputs
  - Continuous
  - Impossible to rep. faults
  - Noise bugs
  - Problem amplified
  - Traditional debugging text based
  - New tools
  
4: Introduction - Augmented Reality
  - AR techologies emerging
  - Augmeneted space combines
  - Humans understand 3D
  - Robots undersand digital augments
  - Allowing to share broaden comms
  
5: Introduction - Project Concept
  - Considering three topics; aims
  - Live video feed
  - Wireless data
  - Combine in AR fashion
  - Improve human debugging of SR
  
6: Background - Hardware (Robot)
  - Hardware elements
  - Practical work YRL
  - Target robot EPuck
  - Widely used small educational
  - Linux extension board
  - Linux high level control
  
7: Background - Hardware (Camera)
  - Infrastructure arena + camera
  - Project incorporates this existing hardware
  - Uses ARuCo to track + do overlays
  
8: Background - Hardware (ARuCo)
  - Marker examples
  - Mounting
  
9: Design - System Architecture
  - Diagram shows general system architecture
  - Robots (green) communicate WiFi
  - Camera sends video
  - Application (blue) back end combines
  - Presents to user in GUI
  
10: Design - Software Architecture
  - MVC
  - Model stores
  - View displays + handles input
  - Controller in between; all data processing
  - Receives robot data and camera feed
  - Updates data model and redraws UI
  - Application is threaded
  - Three key threads
  - Overall design; modular, OOP, extensible
  
11: Design - UI
  - Part of the design process
  - Basic layout here
  - Three main panels with extra tabs
  - Blue visualiser shows video + tabs settings
  - Green robot list
  - Yellow details tabs for data types
  
12: Design - UI Image
  - Translated
  - Qt
  - Open CV
  
13: Progress - Application
  - Implemented in C++; 
  - low level control; performance; native Qt/CV API
  - Existing YRL code
  - Core features all implemented; robot tracking, video augmentation
  
14: Progress - Application (2)
  - Data display
  - IR data

15: Progress - Application (3)
  - State transition
  - Custom user data
  - Back end code complete
  - Data model and data receive
  
16: Progress - Robot Code
  - On robot side single class API
  - Handles basic networking
  - Implemented in C++
  - Designed platform agnostic, portable
  
17: Future Work - Remaining Features
  - Look into additional data types to support
  - Accelerometer
  - Battery level
  - Develop overlays
  - More user configuration
  - Data logging

18: Future Work - Testing and Evaulation strategy
  - Portion of remaining work
  - Manual UI testing
  - Unit test data model
  - Holistic verification testing
  - Evaluation through observed user trials
  - User monitors swarm, tries to identify an issue
  - Survey of experience
  
19: Future Work - Potential Future Development
  - Initial survey showed interest
  - Potential to develop into a full SR platform
  - Extra features
  - Extended to support more robot platforms
  - Bluetooth as well as wifi
  - Port to real AR platform; hololens
  - More immersive interaction
 
 20: Conclusion
  - Tackle SR problems with graphical real time tool
  - Modular extensible design
  - Implementation nearly complete
  - Potential for future development
  - Hopefully useful within the YRL and wider SR field
