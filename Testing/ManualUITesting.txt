UI Element:                     Visualiser Panel Tab System

Purpose:                        Allows access to the different tabs within the visualiser panel.

Statement of Functionality:     Must display the names of the different tabs. 
                                Must allow user to click on the tabs to change between them.
								Required tabs are Visualiser, Settings, and Camera
                                
Testing Strategy:               A


1. Examine UI element. Is it visually correct? Does it contain all elements to satisfy its purpose?

  - Visually correct, all tabs visible.

  
2. Check all text within for meaning or spelling errors if necessary

  - All spelling correct. Meaning is satisfactory, although 'Settings' is ambiguous, relation to visualiser infered through context.


3. Check that all actionable sub elements operate correctly. Do they satisfy the stated functionality?

  - All tabs accessable, the panel changes tab with each click. Satisfies functionality requirements. 
  
  
3a. Check that functionality responds quickly to user input.

  - Response is immediate.
  
  
3b. Check that functionality does not degrade in extreme cases (actionable elements used very quickly, large number of times, etc).

  - Rapidly changing tabs does not have any detrimental affect.
  
  
4. Check that all data displayed by the element is visible, readable, correctly arranged, correctly labelled.

  - n/a
  
  
5. Check that the element behaves sensibly when risizing occurs, and it remains usable and readable whenever possible.

  - Tabs are not affected by resizing. All tabs fit within the panels minimum size. Tabs are hidden if the panel is dragged below its minimum size, causing it to be minimized. Satisfactory behaviour.
  
  
6. Check that the element updates promptly when responding to changes in the data.

  - n/a
  

Fixes Required: 

  - No urgent fixes required. Consider renaming the settings tab to make its purpose clearer.

UI Element:                     Visualiser Settings Tab

Purpose:                        Displays the current settings for the visualiser and allows the user to change them.

Statement of Functionality:     Must correctly display the current visualiser settings.
                                Must allow the user to adjust the general visualiser settings.
                                Must allow the user access to the settings dialogs for specific visualisations.
                                
Testing Strategy:               A


1. Examine UI element. Is it visually correct? Does it contain all elements to satisfy its purpose?

  - Panel layout is correct. Contains sufficient components to satisfy the intented functionality. 

  
2. Check all text within for meaning or spelling errors if necessary

  - All spelling correct. All meanings clear. Headings look very similar to other labels, could use bold font or similar to improve clarity.


3. Check that all actionable sub elements operate correctly. Do they satisfy the stated functionality?

  - All settings controls work correctly. Each visualiser config element can be double clicked to display relevent extra settings. Double clicking on elements with no extra settings has no effect / no error thrown.
  
  
3a. Check that functionality responds quickly to user input.

  - Response is immediate.
  
  
3b. Check that functionality does not degrade in extreme cases (actionable elements used very quickly, large number of times, etc).

  - Rapidly enabling / disabling elements has no adverse effects. Rapidly opening and closing further settings windows has no adverse effect as windows are displayed modally. UI appears robust. Each time robot colours are disabled and re-enabled a different colour set is used. This behaviour should be formalised to avoid confusion; robot colours should remain the same unless the user wishes to change them.
  
  
4. Check that all data displayed by the element is visible, readable, correctly arranged, correctly labelled.

  - Information regarding the current settings is readable, clear, well arranged and clearly labeled. Detailed settings for each visualisation element are described in text.
  
  
5. Check that the element behaves sensibly when risizing occurs, and it remains usable and readable whenever possible.

  - All text fits within the minimum panel width. When the height of the panel is reduce scroll bars are added to allow access to each item in the visualiser config list. All components are hidden when the window is reduced below its minimum size and minimized. Satisfatory behaviour.
  
  
6. Check that the element updates promptly when responding to changes in the data.

  - Changes to the visualisation settings are reflected immediately. Changes to the general settings are reflected immediately.
  

Fixes Required:
  
  - None

Purpose:                        Allows quick access to specific functionality.

Statement of Functionality:     Must display the names of the functions avaliable.
                                Must peform these functions when they are clicked by the user.
                                
Testing Strategy:               A


1. Examine UI element. Is it visually correct? Does it contain all elements to satisfy its purpose?

  - Toolbar appearance is correct, sub menus working.

  
2. Check all text within for meaning or spelling errors if necessary

  - Spelling correct and meanings clear.


3. Check that all actionable sub elements operate correctly. Do they satisfy the stated functionality?

  - All menu items working correctly.
  
  
3a. Check that functionality responds quickly to user input.

  - Responses are immediate.
  
  
3b. Check that functionality does not degrade in extreme cases (actionable elements used very quickly, large number of times, etc).

  - Rapid use of the menu sometimes causes it to not be displayed or dissapear correctly. This is a known bug in ubuntu, and not related to the application.
  
  
4. Check that all data displayed by the element is visible, readable, correctly arranged, correctly labelled.

  - Settings are correctly displayed in the menus.
  
  
5. Check that the element behaves sensibly when risizing occurs, and it remains usable and readable whenever possible.

  - Resizing has no effect on the toolbar or menus.
  
  
6. Check that the element updates promptly when responding to changes in the data.

  - Menu is updated immediately with changes to the settings.

  - All settings controls working correctly.
  
  
3a. Check that functionality responds quickly to user input.

  - Settings changes are applied immediately after pressing apply.
  
  
3b. Check that functionality does not degrade in extreme cases (actionable elements used very quickly, large number of times, etc).

  - Repeated use of the windows has no detrimental affect on functionality. Repeated use of settings controls has no detrimental affect as changes are only applied after apply button is pressed.
  
  
4. Check that all data displayed by the element is visible, readable, correctly arranged, correctly labelled.

  - All settings are displayed correctly when the windows are openened. All settings are correctly labeled.

Results:

Most tests were successful, and the UI is largely functional and robust, with no serious issues. Some minor aesthetic fixes needed, as listed below.

Required Fixes:

  - Consider renaming the settings tab on the visualiser panel to make its purpose clearer.
  - Handle long directory paths on the logging tab more gracefully.
  - Reverse the ordering of messages in the console so that they read from top to bottom in order, as is intuitive.
  - The overview tab has the heading overview at the top which duplicates the labeling on the tab itself and can be removed.
  - Improve clarity of state transition information by rearranging / clarifying time stamp.
  - The IR data tab needs a number of improvements:
    - Add clear headings to clarify meanings of values.
    - Rarrange to maximize the user of space, better arrange numerical labels.
    - Add scroll bar to handle resizing issues.
    - Generally improve IR data display for clarity.
  - When closing the IR or path settings dialogs all of the visualiser settings toggles appear to be forgotten by the UI
