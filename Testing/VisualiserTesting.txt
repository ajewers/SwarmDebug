Data Visualisation Type:        IR Sensor Data

Purpose:                        Overlay a graphical representation of the robots most recent infra-red sensor data

Features:                       Graphical representation of IR data values
                                Positioned to match IR sensor locations / angles on robot
                                Proximity display mode - renders a line of length inversely proportional to the sensor value, from the center of the robot outwards, at the angle of each sensor.
                                'Heat' display mode - renders a box adjacent to the robot, positioned to match the sensor layout, that grows larger and changes colour with increasing sensor value
                                Adjusted to match robot orientation as it moves

Settings:                       On / off (toggle)
